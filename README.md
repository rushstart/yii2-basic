### Install via Composer

You can then install this project template using the following command:

~~~


### Install from an Archive File

Extract the archive file downloaded from (https://github.com/rushstart/yii2-basic/archive/master.zip) to
a directory named `basic` that is directly under the Web root.

Copy files from the `install` directory to the base directory

Set cookie validation key in `config/web-local.php` file to some random secret string:

```php
'request' => [
    // !!! insert a secret key in the following (if it is empty) - this is required by cookie validation
    'cookieValidationKey' => '<secret random string goes here>',
],
```
**NOTES:**
- After install you can remove the `install` directory


CONFIGURATION
-------------

### Database

Edit the file `config/main-local.php` with real data, for example:

```php
'db' => [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=yii2basic',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '1234',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
],
```

And run migration
~~~
yii migrate/up

**NOTES:**
- Yii won't create the database for you, this has to be done manually before you can access it.
- Check and edit the other files in the `config/` directory to customize your application as required.
